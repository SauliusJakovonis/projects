                    <p1>
                        This game is played on a "stand-up" board which has seven hollow columns and six rows. Each column has a hole in the upper part of the board, where pieces are introduced.
                    </p1>
                    <h2 id="rules-title">Objective</h2>
                    <p1>
                        The aim for both players is to make a consecutive line of four pieces of the player's colour. This line can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.
                    </p1>
                    <h2 id="rules-title">Game Progression</h2>
                    <p1>Before starting, players decide randomly which one of them will be the starter, moves are made alternatively, one per turn.
                        <br/>
                        Moves entail placing new pieces at the top of the board, pieces slide downwards from there, falling down to the bottom, or piling up on the last piece introduced in the same column. So, every turn the introduced piece may be placed at most on seven different locations.
                        <br/>
                        The winner is the first player who can get four consecutive pieces of their colour.</p1>
